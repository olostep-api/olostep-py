class RetryStrategy:
    """Configuration for automatic retry behavior with exponential backoff and jitter.
    
    The RetryStrategy controls how the SDK handles transient API errors by automatically
    retrying failed requests with increasing delays between attempts. This helps handle
    temporary network issues, rate limits, and other transient failures gracefully.
    
    Attributes:
        max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 5).
            The total number of attempts will be max_retries (first attempt is not counted).
            For example, max_retries=5 means up to 6 total attempts (1 initial + 5 retries).
            
        initial_delay: Initial delay in seconds before the first retry (default: 2.0).
            This value is doubled for each subsequent retry using exponential backoff.
            For example, with initial_delay=2.0:
            - Retry 1: ~2-3.6s delay
            - Retry 2: ~4-7.2s delay  
            - Retry 3: ~8-14.4s delay
            
        jitter_min: Minimum jitter as a fraction of the delay (default: 0.1 = 10%).
            Jitter adds randomization to prevent thundering herd problems when many
            clients retry simultaneously. This is the lower bound of the random range.
            
        jitter_max: Maximum jitter as a fraction of the delay (default: 0.9 = 90%).
            This is the upper bound of the random jitter range. The actual jitter
            applied will be a random value between jitter_min and jitter_max.
    
    Examples:
        Default retry strategy (5 retries, 2s initial, 10-90% jitter):
        >>> strategy = RetryStrategy()
        >>> strategy.max_duration()
        57.0
        
        Conservative strategy (3 retries, 1s initial, 20-80% jitter):
        >>> strategy = RetryStrategy(max_retries=3, initial_delay=1.0, jitter_min=0.2, jitter_max=0.8)
        >>> strategy.max_duration()
        12.6
        
        Aggressive strategy (10 retries, 0.5s initial):
        >>> strategy = RetryStrategy(max_retries=10, initial_delay=0.5)
        >>> strategy.max_duration()
        969.75
        
        No retries (fail fast):
        >>> strategy = RetryStrategy(max_retries=0)
        >>> strategy.max_duration()
        0.0
    
    Notes:
        - Retries only occur for transient errors (temporary server issues, timeouts)
        - Non-retryable errors (authentication, validation, not found) fail immediately
        - The retry strategy only applies to the caller layer (API-level errors)
        - Network-level connection retries are handled separately by the transport layer
